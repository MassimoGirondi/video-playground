# Video ML

A collection of tests and benchmark for ML/AI applied to videos.


## TODO

What is that we are actually doing here?


# Install

`virtualenv` should be enough, and all deps could be installed via `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Else, via conda:

- First, get yourself a conda installation
- Activate it (if you don't have it in your .bashrc/.zshrc: `source ~/sw/anaconda3/zsh_init`
- Then create an environment: `conda create python=3.11 --prefix ./conda`
- Activate it: `conda activate /home/massimo/prj/ml/video/conda`
- Install things: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
-
